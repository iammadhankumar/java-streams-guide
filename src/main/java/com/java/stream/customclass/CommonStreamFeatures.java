/**
 * CommonStreamOperations class demonstrates various Stream API features 
 * using a custom Employee class with multiple attributes. This class 
 * includes examples of filtering, mapping, reducing, and collecting data 
 * from a list of Employee objects.
 * 
 * Features demonstrated:
 * 1. Filtering employees by department.
 * 2. Mapping employee data to different types (e.g., names).
 * 3. Flattening nested data structures (skills).
 * 4. Distinct values (job titles).
 * 5. Sorting employees by experience.
 * 6. Peek for debugging.
 * 7. Reducing to find maximum salary.
 * 8. Counting full-time employees.
 * 9. Grouping employees by department.
 * 10. Finding the first employee from a specific department.
 * 11. Checking conditions with anyMatch.
 * 12. Processing with parallel streams for performance.
